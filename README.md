# Epilepsy seizure detection using ML

## Overview

This project employs LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM) models for detecting epileptic seizures in EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. The models are trained on labeled EEG data to classify segments as either seizure or non-seizure.
