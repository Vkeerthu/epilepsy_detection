# Epilepsy seizure detection using ML

## Overview

This project employs LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM) models for detecting epileptic seizures in EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. The models are trained on labeled EEG data to classify segments as either seizure or non-seizure.


## Introduction

This project aims to provide an effective solution for the detection of epileptic seizures through the use of deep learning models, specifically LSTM and BiLSTM. The models are trained to analyze EEG signals and categorize them into seizure or non-seizure classes.

# Tools Used

This project makes use of the following tools and technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the seizure detection models.

- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Deep learning frameworks used for building and training LSTM and BiLSTM models.

- **NumPy and Pandas**: Libraries for data manipulation and preprocessing.

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization and result plotting.

- **Scikit-learn**: Used for evaluating model performance and calculating metrics.

- **Git**: Version control system used for tracking changes in the source code.

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.

- ** [Optional]Virtualenv or Conda**: Tools for creating isolated Python environments to manage dependencies.

Please ensure you have these tools installed and configured before running the project.
