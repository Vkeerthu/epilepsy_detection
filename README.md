## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an Epilepsy Detection system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks. The goal is to predict epileptic seizures based on EEG (Electroencephalogram) data.

## Models Implemented

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for handling long-range dependencies.
- **BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM):** An extension of LSTM that processes the input sequence in both forward and backward directions.
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** Another variant of RNN, similar to LSTM but with a simplified architecture.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [Epileptic Seizure Recognition Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Epileptic+Seizure+Recognition) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Other dependencies (specified in requirements.txt)

## Setup



    
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train and evaluate the models.

## Usage

- Execute the provided Jupyter Notebook `epilepsy_detection.ipynb` for a step-by-step walkthrough.
- Alternatively, use the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory for training and testing specific models.

## Results

| Model      | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| LSTM       | 90%      | 91%       | 89%    | 90%      |
| BiLSTM     | 92%      | 92%       | 91%    | 92%      |
| GRU        | 89%      | 88%       | 90%    | 89%      |
