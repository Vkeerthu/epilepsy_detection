# Epilepsy seizure detection using ML

## Overview

This project employs LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM) models for detecting epileptic seizures in EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. The models are trained on labeled EEG data to classify segments as either seizure or non-seizure.


## Introduction

This project aims to provide an effective solution for the detection of epileptic seizures through the use of deep learning models, specifically LSTM and BiLSTM. The models are trained to analyze EEG signals and categorize them into seizure or non-seizure classes.
